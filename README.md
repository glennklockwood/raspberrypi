Raspberry Pi
================================================================================

These are various scripts I made while playing around with [physical computing]
[] on my Raspberry Pi using its GPIO and the [camera module][].  Most of these
scripts are just demonstrations of basic functionality.

The most noteworthy script is `cd4017be.py`, which is a Python implementation
of the [CD4017BE][] counter/divider IC.  I created it as a replacement for the
physical CD4017BE that came with a [Spinning LED Wheel Kit][MK152RS] with which
I've been playing.
